    <h1> Welcome To the Page by Khari Walker </h1>
    <!-- Title and Header -->
    <p> Hello, my name is <em>Khari</em> <em>Walker</em>. I am a <ins>sophomore</ins> and undecided in my major. However,
    two majors that I am interested in are STS and Computer Science. </p>    
     <br />
    <p class="second">I am currently working at the Wellness and Recreation Center on NC States campus 
    as an intramural basketball referee. Out of all the jobs that I have worked my favorite
    was being a Sales Associate for Outside Lawn and Garden at Lowes Home Improvement. 
    While labor could be a little intense at times, but the pay was decent and the job had 
    its times to be enjoyable our interesting. My dream job however, is to be a video game 
    designer.</p>
